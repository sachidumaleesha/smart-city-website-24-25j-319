            Research Project Scope
          </h2>
          <p className="text-center text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-300">
            This project aims to develop a smart city system using computer
            vision technology. The system will focus on four key areas: Vehicle
            Parking Management, Special Incident Detection, Surveillance
            Enhancement, and Automated Waste Management. It will use cameras,
            sensors, and artificial intelligence to improve city operations. The
            goal is to make parking more efficient, quickly spot road
            emergencies, enhance public safety through better monitoring, and
            make waste collection smarter. By combining these technologies, the
            project hopes to create a more efficient and livable urban
            environment.

            Research Problem
          </h2>
          <p className="text-center text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-300">
            As cities grow, they face increasing challenges in managing traffic,
            ensuring safety, and handling waste. Traditional methods of urban
            management are struggling to keep up with these complex issues.
            There's a need for smarter, more efficient ways to run cities and
            improve the quality of life for residents. This project addresses
            the problem of how to use advanced technology, specifically computer
            vision, to solve these urban challenges. The key issue is finding
            ways to make city systems more responsive, efficient, and effective
            in real-time.

            Research Objectives
          </h2>
          <p className="text-center text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-300">
            The main objective of this research is to use computer vision
            technology to improve various aspects of city management. The system
            aims to enhance urban efficiency, safety, and sustainability through
            advanced monitoring and automation. By integrating cutting-edge
            technologies, the project seeks to create smarter, more responsive
            urban environments that benefit all residents.
