# 🏙️ SMART CITY WITH COMPUTER VISION

## 🔍 Research Project ID: 24-25J-319

### 📋 Project Description

Urbanization has increased population density and infrastructure strain in cities, creating challenges in managing urban environments efficiently. Traditional methods of urban management struggle with the complexities of modern cities. Smart cities aim to address these issues by integrating advanced technologies to improve residents' quality of life, enhance sustainability, and optimize urban services. Computer vision, a rapidly evolving subset of artificial intelligence, offers promising solutions to several urban challenges.

This research project focuses on leveraging computer vision technology to enhance various aspects of smart city infrastructure, particularly in:

- 🔒 **Surveillance Enhancement**: Automating surveillance with real-time threat detection and analysis
- 🚗 **Traffic Management**: Improving traffic flow and detecting special incidents on motorways
- 🗑️ **Waste Management**: Revolutionizing waste sorting and classification through automation
- 🅿️ **Parking Management**: Developing efficient systems for managing vehicle parking
